# .config
Before using these, a few environment variables need to be set:

WEZTERM_CONFIG_DIR = <HOMEPATH>\.config\wezterm
WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE = <WEZTERM_CONFIG_DIR>\wezterm.lua
GLAZEWM_CONFIG_PATH = <HOMEPATH>\.config\glazewm\config.yaml

After that, you're most likely going to have to restart.
From there, things should just work.

Copy this to <HOMEPATH>
